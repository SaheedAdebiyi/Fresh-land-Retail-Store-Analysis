## Project Background
This analysis was conducted to identify the root causes and focus on improving operations, marketing, and customer satisfaction by analyzing sales and customer data. To determine peak hours to optimize staff schedules, evaluate the loyalty program to see if it drives value, target marketing more effectively based on purchasing patterns, and assess high-value customer satisfaction to enhance their experience. The insights from this analysis will help reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve overall customer loyalty. This project analyzes available data and produces an interactive Excel dashboard with actionable recommendations.

3.  Study who buys each product category so that marketing efforts are focused on the right audience and the budget is used effectively.
4.  Examine whether high-spending customers are satisfied and take steps to improve their experience to maintain their loyalty.

## Key Findings (example)
1.  Customer Satisfaction Crisis: Despite strong sales of $666.8 million, only 32% of customers are highly satisfied, while 34% are dissatisfied, indicating a significant experience gap      that  threatens retention
2.  Membership Program Success: Member customers generate $335.3 million in revenue compared to $331.2 million from normal customers, demonstrating the loyalty program's strong value in      driving sales
3.  Digital Payment Dominance: E-wallet ($222.7 Million) and credit cards ($220.9 Million) account for 67% of transactions, with cash at $223.1 million, showing successful digital            adoption
4.  Austin Leads Performance: Austin consistently outperforms Chicago and New York across categories and time periods, suggesting replicable best practices in operations and customer         service.
5.  Seasonal Revenue Vulnerability: Revenue drops significantly in Q1 (especially February) before peaking in November, exposing the business to seasonal demand fluctuations

## Recommendations
1. Prioritize Customer Satisfaction Recovery: Conduct feedback surveys, implement mystery shopping, and create rapid response teams to reduce dissatisfied customers from 34% to below
2. Replicate Austin's Success Model: Document Austin's best practices and deploy their top performers to train Chicago and New York teams to achieve performance parity across all            locations
3. Expand Membership and Address Seasonality: Introduce tiered membership benefits, launch specific promotions, and develop targeted campaigns to increase the member ratio to 65% while      stabilizing seasonal revenue
4. Optimize Digital Payments and Category Mix: Enhance e-wallet infrastructure with backup systems, invest in top-performing categories like Sports & Travel, and restructure                 underperforming segments like Electronic Accessories
